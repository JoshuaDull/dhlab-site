    <p>The Digital Humanities Lab funds a number of annual postdoctoral associate positions each academic year. During those application cycles, we seek energetic and creative applicants who demonstrate innovative thinking and a proactive approach to the questions that digital humanities methods, approaches, tools, and theories raise in their academic disciplines.</p>
    <p>Each Postdoctoral Associate has a dedicated workspace in the DHLab in Sterling Memorial Library; the opportunity to collaborate with technical staff, including a DH Developer and UX Designer; and a budget for computing equipment, professional development, and relocation expenses. The Postdoctoral Associate's primary responsibility is to his or her own research project. We also expect candidates will be active participants in the intellectual life of the DHLab. The Director of the Digital Humanities Lab will coordinate their integration into the DHLab.</p>

    <p>Yale's roots in digital humanities undertakings date back (at least) to Father Roberto Busa's visit to our campus on September 24, 1956. Father Busa is credited with being the founder of humanities computing. His concordance of the works of Saint Thomas Aquinas is the founding example of digital humanities research.</p>
    <p>Generously funded by the Goizueta Foundation, the DHLab is committed to advancing science, technology, engineering, the arts, and mathematics (STEAM) teaching and research at Yale. In addition to facilitating cross-disciplinary collaborations on campus, the DHLab also promotes faculty and student initiatives that reach beyond the University to engage wider publics.</p>
