    <p>Leveraging a wide range of techniques from neural networks to 3D-immersive realities, digital humanities projects at Yale bring innovative technologies to bear on long-standing historical and cultural questions.</p>

    <p>As both a technical and theoretical enterprise, digital humanities touches on a wide range of scholarly techniques, bringing different discplines into conversation with one another. From English and History to Computer Science and Statistics, the range of scholarly disciplines that inform digital humanities research continues to grow.</p>

    <p>When beginning a digital humanities project, it is oftentimes important to first articulate your research question(s), and then to decide how and what technology can best help you answer that question.</p>

    <p>If you need help clearly outlining your research questions or deciding whether algorithmic approaches might be helpful, feel free to stop by the Digital Humanities Lab during Office Hours on Tuesdays and Wednesdays from 2:00pm-4:00pm. We will be happy to discuss your project and some of the methods and tools that might be appropriate.</p>
