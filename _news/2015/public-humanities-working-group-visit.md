The Yale Public Humanities Working Group visited the DHLab on October 13 to tour the space and discuss productive crossovers in digital humanities and public humanities initiatives. DHLab Director, <a href="http://resources.library.yale.edu/StaffDirectory/detail.aspx?q=718" target="_blank"> Peter Leonard </a>, began the discussion by introducing the Lab, and <a href="http://resources.library.yale.edu/StaffDirectory/detail.aspx?q=631" target="_blank"> Lindsay King </a> (Robert B. Haas Family Arts Library), <a href="http://resources.library.yale.edu/StaffDirectory/detail.aspx?q=107" target="_blank"> Lisa Conathan </a> Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library), and <a href="http://resources.library.yale.edu/StaffDirectory/detail.aspx?q=806" target="_blank"> Catherine DeRose </a> (Digital Humanities Lab) each highlighted example crossover projects.

Lindsay demoed <a href="http://web.library.yale.edu/dhlab/ensemble" target="_blank"> Ensemble </a>, a crowdsourcing effort for Yale playbills that is modeled after the New York Public Library's <a href="http://menus.nypl.org/" target="_blank"> What's on the Menu? </a>, Lisa presented on a Cherokee Transcription project that works with a collection held in Beinecke Library, and Catherine provided an overview of Carnegie Hall's <a href="http://www.carnegiehall.org/Lullaby/" target="_blank"> Lullaby Project</a>, which pairs mothers and musicians together. The conversation continued informally after the presentations, as people interacted with the space and tried out additional Lab projects.
