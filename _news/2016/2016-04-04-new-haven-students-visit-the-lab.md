The Digital Humanities Lab welcomed junior high and high school students from around the New Haven area for a workshop on DH. Following a tour of the lab and a discussion of old and new media, students learned about the <a href="http://photogrammar.yale.edu/" target="_blank"> Photogrammar </a> project and participated in a scavenger hunt to find images of American life during the Great Depression and World War II.
  
The workshop was led by Catherine DeRose (Outreach Manager for the DHLab) and Lauren Tilton (PhD Candidate in American Studies).
