Each semester, the Digital Humanities Lab appoints one or more Digital Humanities Fellows to assist with courses that have a strong digital humanities component. These positions provide semester-long support for graduate students to engage with DH methods and theories in a classroom setting. DHLab staff will work with fellows to design DH assignments, arrange access to electronic content, and provide specialized technical training.
