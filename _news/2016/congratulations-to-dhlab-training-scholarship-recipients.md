The Digital Humanities Lab would like to congratulate the recipients from the inaugural round of DHLab Training Scholarships: Andrew Wang (first-year PhD student in English), Masha Shpolberg (third-year PhD student in Comparative Literature and Film &amp; Media Studies), and Graziano Kr√§tli (Digital Projects and Technology Librarian, Divinity School Library). The $500 awards will help support their participation in week-long courses at the upcoming Digital Humanities Summer Institute. The courses include: "Feminist Digital Humanities: Theoretical, Social, and Material Engagements," "Digital Storytelling," and "Digital Humanities Databases."
   
DHLab Training Scholarships are open to Yale undergraduates, graduate students, and librarians. There will be a second round of Training Scholarships announced and awarded later in the spring semester.
