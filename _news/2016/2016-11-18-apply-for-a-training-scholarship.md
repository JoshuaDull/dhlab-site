<h2>Training Scholarships for 2017</h2>
   
Interested in learning how to build a database or code with R? Apply for a Digital Humanities Training Scholarship! YaleÂ  undergraduates, graduate students, and librarians are eligible to apply. These scholarships support participation in week-long DH workshops.
   
For more information, visit our <a href="http://web.library.yale.edu/dhlab/trainingscholarships" target="_blank"> Training Scholarships </a> page. Not sure which workshop is right for you, check out our <a href="http://web.library.yale.edu/dhlab/offcampusworkshops" target="_blank"> Off-Campus Workshops </a> page or send us an email at <a href="mailto:dhlab@yale.edu"> dhlab@yale.edu</a>!

Courses at the <a href="http://www.dhsi.org/" target="_blank"> Digital Humanities Summer Institute </a>(DHSI) are already beginning to fill up, so we recommend applying now. A second round of DHLab Training Scholarships will be available in the spring for workshops that don't yet have their schedules posted.
