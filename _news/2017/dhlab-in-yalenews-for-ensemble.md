What is the most-produced play at Yale? Which actors have played Hamlet on our stages?

To find out, the Digital Humanities Lab and Robert B. Haas Family Arts Library created Ensemble @ Yale, a platform for crowdsourced transcription, that was recently featured in YaleNews.

Covering 90 years of Yale's theater history, Ensemble @ Yale provides full-text access to playbills from the Yale School of Drama, Yale Repertory Theatre, and other theatrical groups on campus. Visitors to the site have the option to login and help transcribe or mark playbills, which are organized by decade, by drawing boxes around titles, actors, directors, and more. No Yale affiliation is required to login and participate.
    
Check out <a href="http://news.yale.edu/2017/05/24/crowd-sourced-project-build-yale-theater-history-database" target="_blank"> YaleNews's website </a> for an interview with Lindsay King, one of the projects principal investigators.
