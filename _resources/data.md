Whenever possible, the Yale University Library works with database vendors to include text and data mining (TDM) rights in license agreements. This means that for some databases (generally ones with out-of-copyright materials), Yale researchers can access the raw text for the purposes of mining. Vendors that currently permit text and data mining on specific collections include: Adam Matthew, Gale, ProQuest, and others. For additional information on these agreements and which collections are available for mining, please visit the <a href='https://guides.library.yale.edu/tdm' target='_blank'>Text and Data Mining LibGuide</a>.

What about for material that hasn't been digitized yet? Scanners in the Digital Humanities Lab may be used for the purposes of creating digital corpora for mining purposes (rather than for textual preservation or personal archives). To that end, Yale scholars may use specialized equipment in the lab to transform physical materials, such as books and microfilm, into digitally-actionable research objects. These scanners require training and are only to be used for digital humanities projects actively underway. For all-purpose scanning, researchers may use the machines in the Nave of Sterling Memorial Library or in the lower level of Bass Library.
