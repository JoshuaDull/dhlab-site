  Office hours at the Digital Humanities Lab
---

Looking to start a digital project but don't know where to begin? Need recommendations on programming languages or visualization fundamentals? Stop by the Digital Humanities Lab during open Office Hours to chat with our team over coffee.
 
Office Hours provide a weekly opportunity to exchange ideas, discuss methods, and form connections with colleagues from different programs and departments. If you are interested in sharing your work in the form of a 10-minute lightning talk at the beginning of Office Hours, email the DHLab.
 
Whether you are new to the field and would like to learn more, have existing projects and seek a communal workspace, or are somewhere in between, we invite you to stop by!

When: Every Tuesday and Wednesday—including during the summer—from 2:00pm-4:00pm

Where: DHLab (Sterling Memorial Library, 316)

Who: Everyone in the Yale community, no advanced registration required
