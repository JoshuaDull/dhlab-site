Looking for code to try out? Interested in what's underlying the DHLab's projects? Check out our [GitHub](https://github.com/YaleDHLab) repositories! We strive to create open and accessible projects.

Our GitHub repo also houses instructions from our workshops, making it a great place to visit if you couldn't attend or would like a refresher on what we covered. If you have an idea for a workshop that's not listed, submit a "new issue" on the Workshops page, and we'll get back to you!
