Yaleâ€™s world-class collections offer unparalleled source material for humanistic inquiries. With the increasing support for digital scholarship on campus, we can now push these inquiries further by incorporating digital methods that allow us to see our (literary, historical, cultural, artistic) data at new scales.

Located within Sterling Memorial Library (rm 316), the Digital Humanities Lab supports faculty, graduate students, and undergraduates on a broad range of digital humanities undertakings. Possible digital methods include but are not limited to text-tagging, mapping, network analysis, and topic modeling. An open, communal workspace, the DHLab contains computers with specialized software and self-serve scanners that can be used for digital humanities research. Stop by any time we're open, Monday through Friday!
