Yaleâ€™s world-class collections offer unparalleled source material for humanistic inquiries. With the launch of the DHLab in fall 2015, we can now push these inquiries further by incorporating digital methods that allow us to see our (literary, historical, cultural, artistic) data at new scales.

The DHLab supports faculty, graduate students, and undergraduates on a broad range of digital humanities undertakings. Possible digital methods include but are not limited to text-tagging, GIS mapping, network analysis, and topic modeling.
