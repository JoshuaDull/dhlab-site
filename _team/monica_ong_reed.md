An M.F.A. graduate in Digital Media from the Rhode Island School of Design, Monica first came to Yale as designer for the School of Music (2007-2015) to lead initiatives in web and mobile publishing. Her design for the YSM website was nominated for a Webby Award in 2014 and recognized by the W3 Awards and the Connecticut Art Director’s Club.

As a collaborator in the University’s efforts to expand its digital collections, Monica also created the user interface for the Yale Collection of Musical Instruments’ online catalog, providing a framework for multi-media discovery experiences.

Also a Kundiman poetry fellow, Monica’s debut collection, Silent Anatomies (2015), was selected by Joy Harjo as winner of the 2014 Kore Press First Book Award.
