Catherine DeRose is the Engagement and Outreach Manager for the DHLab. Catherine comes to Yale from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where she received a PhD in British literature, with a minor in Humanities Computing and Design. Her current research considers how Victorian authors thought about text preservation during the print explosion in the nineteenth-century and how the concerns (and solutions) they raised resonate with today's issues surrounding archives and mass digitization.

Catherine has been actively involved in digital humanities initiatives at UW-Madison, as well as at Carnegie Hall and the Folger Shakespeare Library. Her work has appeared in Victorian Review and Significance, and she has received grants for digital humanities research from the American Council of Learned Societies (ACLS) and the New Arts Venture Challenge.
