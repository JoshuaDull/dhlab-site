## Intro to Git
*October 25 at 2:00pm-4:00pm in Bass Library, L06*  
   
Learn how to use Git at the DHLab's next Coffee and Code! During the workshop, DH Developer Douglas Duhaime will cover the fundamentals of Git â€” a free, open source version control system. Participants will learn how to create repositories and branches, manage pull requests, and commit changes.
   
Git provides a robust system for collaborating with team members and finding existing code that you might adopt and adapt for your own projects.

Lab computers will be available for use, but participants are welcome to bring their own laptops.
