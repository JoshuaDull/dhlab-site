<h3>Intro to XSLT in Three Parts</h3>
*April 12 from 3:00-5:00pm in Bass Library, L01*

This workshop will provide a basic overview of XSLT as a declarative programming language. The instructor will demonstrate an iterative process of investigating, updating, and reviewing a TEI file with the assistance of XSLT. Every participant will gain hands-on experience transforming an XML document with the oXygen XML Editor, using a supplied XSLT stylesheet, and writing a very simple XSLT stylesheet from scratch. The workshop will conclude with a couple of different methods for publishing TEI online.

No prior encoding experience is required but basic knowledge of XML will be helpful. Participants are encouraged to install the <a href="https://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_editor/register.html#get_trial" target="_blank"> oXygen XML Editor </a> prior to the workshop in order to follow along with the exercises.
    
The workshop is open to all Yale students, faculty, and staff; no registration is required.
   
Co-organized by the Classics Library, the YUL Department of Areas Studies and Humanities Research Support, the Yale Digital Propertius Project, and the Yale Digital Humanities Lab
