The Digital Humanities Lab is excited to sponsor two events with Heather Froehlich, a historical sociolinguist from the University of Strathclyde. Both events are open to the Yale community and public.
   
<h3>Talk, 5/3: "Representations of Madness in Early Modern Drama and EEBO-TCP Phase I"</h3>
*Bass Library, L01 at 2:00pm*
    
In her talk, Heather Froehlich will explore how to use the Historical Thesaurus of the Oxford English Dictionary and Early English Books Online-Text Creation Project (EEBO-TCP) Phase I to understand the language of madness in two subsets of early English print: firstly, in a selection of 336 dramatic works (1514-1662) and secondly in 25,000 transcriptions of early English books. She will demonstrate how to harvest historically relevant terms from the Historical Thesaurus and then apply them to EEBO-TCP. In doing so, she has identified different lexical references to madness, with a clear division in use of the 4-word phrase 'I am not mad' in dramatic and non-dramatic writing.
   
Coffee will be provided!
   
<h3>Workshop, 5/4: "11 Things You Can Do With EEBO-TCP Phase I"</h3>
*Bass Library, L06 at 1:00-4:00pm*

This text mining workshop will overview several ways of interacting with the Early English Books Online-Text Creation Partnership (EEBO-TCP), a full-text transcription database of 25,000 early modern printed books between 1470 and 1700. We will cover strategies for accessing EEBO-TCP, identifying specific transcriptions, tracing specific words/concepts, identifying and modernizing variant spellings, curating subcorpora, and using these resources in a pedagogical context.

**Heather Froehlich** studies social identity in Early Modern London plays (1514-1662) and EEBO-TCP Phase I at the University of Strathclyde (Glasgow, UK), where she is also a research assistant on the Visualizing English Print (1470-1700) project (a collaboration between Strathclyde, UW-Madison, and the Folger Shakespeare Library). Her work draws on socio-historic linguistics and corpus stylistics, though she sustains an interest in digital methods for literary and linguistic inquiry.
