During Office Hours, DHLab Postdoctoral Associate Carol Chiodo presented on a [contextual data mapping workshop](http://www.researchspace.org/home/project-updates/cidoccrmmappingworkshopatoxforduniversity) offered by the University of Oxford. In her talk, Carol spoke to the research potential of web content that is easily and effectively processed by machines. Carol also considered how semantic frameworks could help scholars represent cultural heritage information. Questions and conversation over coffee will followed.

Digital Humanities Office Hours occur every Tuesday from 2:00-3:30pm in the Lab (Sterling Memorial Library, 316). They are an informal chance for people to share ideas, get input on projects, and form connections with colleagues from different programs and departments. All are welcome!
