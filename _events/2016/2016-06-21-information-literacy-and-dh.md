<h3>Heuristic Evaluation for Digital Humanities Projects</h3>
<em>June 21 at 2:00pm in the DHLab (SML 316)</em>
   
During DHLab Office Hours, Alexandra Provo presented on the evaluation of digital humanities projects, with Photogrammar as her case study.
         
Borrowing from user experience research methods, Alex conducted a heuristic evaluation of Photogrammar using the ACRL Framework for Information Literacy and a list of digital humanities learning outcomes as her criteria. Her presentation outlined the evaluation methodology and gave an overview of several of the project's strengths and opportunities.

This talk was co-sponsored by the DHLab and the Yale University Library Reference, Instruction, &amp; Outreach (RIO) Committee.
