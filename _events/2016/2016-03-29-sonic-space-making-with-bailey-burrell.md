Antipathy toward black women is woven into the fabric of American entertainment. Black women cultural producers and consumers continue to negotiate this landscape online and IRL. This workshop invites participants to look at digital music and podcasts created by black women as sites of transformative resistance and as a praxis of alternative world building. We will feature clips from the podcasts *The Prescription*, *There Ought To Be More Dancing*, and *Love in Public* as examples of what digital spaces can create. We will provide participants with the tools and time to create a podcast during the workshop. Drawing on the work of Grace Lee Boggs and the Allied Media Project, we will also discuss theoretical texts that discuss the importance of creation as a form of critical analysis that challenges hegemony in our sensory spaces.
    
This workshop is Part Two of the "Digital Non-Neutrality Series: Decolonizing and Queering DH Tools and Practices," co-organized by T.L. Cowan (MacMillan, DHLab &amp; WGSS) and Marijeta Bozovic (Slavic Languages and Literatures) and sponsored by the Yale DHLab, Women's, Gender and Sexuality Studies, Mellon-funded Re-imagining Digital Humanities at Yale program with Laura Wexler and Inderpal Grewal, and The Whitney and Betty MacMillan Center for International and Area Studies at Yale, and the Canadian Studies Committee.
