The University of Rhode Island's student chapter of the American Library Association visited the DHLab on March 15 for a conversation on emerging opportunities for library professionals who work in and alongside DH. After a tour of the space, the visiting scholars sat down with <a href="http://resources.library.yale.edu/StaffDirectory/detail.aspx?q=1" target="_blank">Allen Townsend</a>(the Associate University Librarian for Arts and Humanities), <a href="http://web.library.yale.edu/dhlab/peterleonard" target="_blank">Peter Leonard</a> (the DHLab's Director), and <a href="http://web.library.yale.edu/dhlab/catherinederose" target="_blank"> Catherine DeRose </a> (the DHLab's Outreach Manager) to discuss a range of DH projects, methodologies, and training opportunities.
