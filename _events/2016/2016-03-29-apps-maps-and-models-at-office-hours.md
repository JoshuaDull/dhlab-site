<h3>DH Office Hours Talk</h3>
<em>March 29 at 2:00pm in the DHLab (SML 316)</em>
   
Danielle Reay, Arts Librarian for Digital and Access Services at Haas Arts Library, will recap the recent symposium “<a href="http://sites.duke.edu/digsymposium/2015/11/18/apps-maps-models-digital-pedagogy-and-research-in-art-history-archaeology-visual-studies/" target="_blank"> Apps, Maps &amp; Models: Digital Pedagogy and Research in Art History, Archaeology &amp; Visual Studies</a>,” which was held at Duke University in February. Her presentation will profile digital projects currently underway in a variety of art historical, visual, and archaeological contexts. In addition to highlighting specific projects (including geospatial mapping with German architectural periodicals and virtual reconstructions that place art in situ), Danielle will also discuss the larger implications for the accessibility and sustainability of these projects.
   
All are welcome! Coffee and tea will be provided.
