<h3>Coffee and Code Workshop: Web Scraping</h3>
*July 14, 2:00-3:30pm in the Digital Humanities Lab (SML 316)*
    
Learn how to gather data from online! Join the Digital Humanities Lab for a Coffee and Code session on web scraping, led by DH Developer Douglas Duhaime. During the workshop, participants will learn and practice the fundamentals by scraping a webpage (or subset of pages) from a domain of the group's choosing. In addition to tackling the "how," we will also discuss "why" and "when" web scraping is appropriate.
   
**Prior to the workshop, please ensure that you have Python 2.7 installed on your computer.**
    
To verify what version of Python you have, open the "Terminal" application and type: `Python`

Please bring your laptop to the session.

All are welcome; no prior programming experience is required. Coffee and tea will be provided!
