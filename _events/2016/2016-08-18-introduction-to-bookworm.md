<h3>Coffee and Code: Introduction to Bookworm</h3>
<em>
  August 18 from 2:00-3:30pm in Bass Library, L06
</em>
   
Visualize word frequencies at the DHLab's Coffee and Code. During the workshop, participants learned how to deploy Bookworm, a tool for analyzing trends in word or phrase frequencies over a designated time span. Sample text files were provided, but participants were encouraged to bring their own data for discussion.

No prior programming experience was required.
