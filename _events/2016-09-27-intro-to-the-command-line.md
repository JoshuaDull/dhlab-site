### Coffee and Code: Introduction to the Command Line
*September 27 from 2:00pm-4:00pm in Bass Library, L06*  
   
Get familiar with the command line at the DHLab's next Coffee and Code! During the workshop, participants will learn the basics of the command line, including how to:

 * create, edit, and move files and directories
 * ssh (secure shell) to remote servers
 * navigate a computer's file system and more!

Windows computers will be available for use, though participants are welcome to bring their own computer (Windows or Mac).

**If you plan to use one of the available Windows machines, please arrive 5 minutes early to the workshop as they take a while to boot up.**
   
**Space is limited; to register, please go to the [YUL Instruction Calendar](http://schedule.yale.edu/event/2829853). Registration is open to Yale students, faculty, and staff; no prior programming experience is required.
   
This workshop will be lead-in to our Intro to Git Coffee and Code on October 25 - keep an eye on our website for more information.
