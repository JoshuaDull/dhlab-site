Julieanna L. Richardson, the Founder and Executive Director of <a href="http://www.thehistorymakers.com/" target="_blank"><em>The HistoryMakers</em></a> nonprofit, visited the DHLab with her team to discuss the need to link public humanities and digital humanities efforts.

<em>The HistoryMakers</em> project contains the largest national collection of African American video oral histories on record. The digital archive currently includes 2,000+ videotaped interviews, totaling over 8,000 hours of footage. These interviews have been transcribed, tagged, and made freely available for viewing. The project aims to record 5,000 interviews, therein preserving African American sung and unsung voices.
   
In addition to visiting the DHLab, Richardson also gave a talk titled, "Building<em>The HistoryMakers</em>: Public Humanities Meets Digital Humanities." Information about the talk can be found <a href="http://web.library.yale.edu/news/2015/10/1015-building-historymakers-public-humanities-meets-digital" target="_blank">here</a>.

Her visit was sponsored by the Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library and the Public Humanities at Yale.
