The Digital Humanities Lab sponsored two events with Joanna Swafford, Assistant Professor for Interdisciplinary and Digital Teaching and Scholarship at SUNY New Paltz. Events were open to the Yale community and public.
   
<h3>**Talk, 4/5:** "Virtually London: Literature and Laptops"</h3>
<em>Hall of Graduate Studies (HGS), 211 at 2:00pm</em>

The technological revolutions of both the Victorian era and our own time make nineteenth-century studies and digital humanities natural allies, particularly in the classroom. This talk presents two courses as case studies: "Digital Tools for the 21st Century: Sherlock Holmes's London," and “Virtually London.” “Digital Tools” uses the Holmes stories as a corpus on which to practice basic digital humanities methodologies and tools, including visualizations, digital archives and editions, GIS, and distant reading, whereas “Virtually London” uses digital archives and narrative maps to study 19th century literature about London, and culminates in creating annotated narrative maps of The Picture of Dorian Gray and The Romance of a Shop.  The talk will present sample assignments and projects from both courses to highlight how digital humanities lets students find new patterns in well-known texts, explore the function of space in literature, and historicize their own technological moment.
