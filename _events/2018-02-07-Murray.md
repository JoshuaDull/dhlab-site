Join us for an Office Talk with Hannah-Rose Murray who will present a map of black abolitionist speaking locations. In her project, she visualizes how far speakers travelled, who they stayed with, and what abolitionist networks they participated in.

Hannah-Rose Murray is a historian at the University of Nottingham and starting in February, a fellow with the Gilder Lehrman Centre.
