The Yale digital humanities team participated in the 2017 DH Conference in Montreal from August 7-11. Highlighted projects by faculty and staff included:
 * *Photogrammar*, a platform for visualizing over 170,000 photographs taken during the Great Depression and World War II
    
 * *Ensemble*, a crowdsourcing application for transcribing 90 years of theatrical programs from the Yale School of Drama and Yale Repertory Theatre

 * *Neural Neighbors*, a forthcoming site from the Digital Humanities Lab for tracking visual similarity across collections of photographs and videos.
    
Presenters from this conference, as well as Yale participants from the Digital Humanities Summer Institute (DHSI), Humanities Intensive Teaching and Learning (HILT), Digital Humanities at Oxford Summer School (DHOxSS), and Esri's Education and User Conferences will share overviews of these events—including the key projects and methodologies that were discussed—at an upcoming Office Hours in the lab this September. Visit the Digital Humanities News &amp; Events page soon for more information.
