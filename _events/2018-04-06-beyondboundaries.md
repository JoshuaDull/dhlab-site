### Beyond Boundaries: A Symposium on Hybrid Scholarship at Yale University
*April 6, 2018 from 9:30am-1:00pm*  
*Sterling Memorial Library, Lecture Hall*  
   
How can virtual reality technologies help us understand poetry? What does music reveal about the brain? To explore these questions and more, join the Digital Humanities Lab and [Yale STEAM](http://steamwith.us/YaleSTEAM.html) for a spring symposium to showcase hybrid scholarship at Yale University. Undergraduates, graduate students, faculty, and staff will present projects that highlight the questions that can be asked and explored via digital methods and collaborations between the sciences and humanities.

If you are interested in presenting a poster or giving a 7-minute lightning talk at the event, please submit a short [online application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeTuMU5uVcURVlvH9BXrCtiIN5jfitKBxSRVtZPslQpOzHQzQ/viewform) by <b>February 19</b>. Poster presenters will have the option to show their work on a computer. Undergraduates, graduate students, postdoctoral associates, faculty, and staff are encouraged to apply.
   
The symposium is open to the entire Yale community and public. Coffee and refreshments will be provided.
