      As an assistant to Professor Heather Klemann, Andrew worked with the DHLab to develop several assignments for the English Department course “Vampires, Castles, Werewolves”. Students learned how to use tools and software in the areas of mapping/GIS, digital curation, and text visualization. In doing so, they had the opportunity to create their own online resources that explore the connections between Gothic literature and the history of art and architecture, as well as the rich, complex publication history that lies behind many of the period’s novels and stories.

      Working on a long history of new media with a special interest in feminist engagements with populist media forms, Bo was excited to work with Professor Wai Chee Dimock on "Performing American Literature," a course that expanded the definition of "performance" to include modes of digital expression, ranging from gaming, spatial and temporal mapping, e-texts, and the creative use of social media.

      As an assistant to Professor R. John Williams, Kim worked with the DHLab to develop a number of digital projects for a course entitled "Countercultures." This course explored a number of states of "altered consciousness" throughout the 1960s and 1970s, offering a more nuanced exploration of what it meant to cultivate an experience that ran "counter" to the dominant practices of American bourgeois society. Students learned how to use network visualization tools, topic mapping, and trend visualization software — as well as a few digital tools by which they can create their own countercultural projects — to better understand the relationship between what runs against mainstream culture, and the mainstream culture that has a tendency to absorb it.

      As a Digital Humanities Fellow, Carlotta worked closely with students in a new course, “Avant-Gardes and Émigrés: Digital Humanities Lab,” with Professor Marijeta Bozovic. She modeled for students several of the Digital Humanities tools and techniques that she learned in the past two years, including but not limited to: an introduction to coding in R with R Studio; topic modeling large corpora through R and Mallet; data gathering and network modeling with Datavis and an introduction to Gephi. She also encouraged and led critical discussions interrogating the limitations and potential pitfalls of the "quantitative turn" in the humanities. Fall 2016

      T.L.'s work with the DHLab will focus on developing a proof-of-concept for The Cabaret Commons: An Online Archive and Anecdotal Encyclopedia for Trans- Feminist and Queer Performers and Audiences. This project entails the development of a hybrid curated and user-generated digital archive of live performance that works towards a responsive and dynamic model of performance archives—one that documents performers and performances and attends to the central role of audiences in sustaining grassroots trans- feminist and queer cultures. The Cabaret Commons project has been generously supported by the Canadian Writing Research Collaboratory (CWRC) and the Social Sciences and Humanities Council of Canada (SSHRC). T.L. is also a practicing performance and video artist and co-founder and co-editor of the Helix Critical Project. 2015-2016
