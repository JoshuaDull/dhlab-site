          <li>Holocaust and Genocide Studies, Twentieth-Century European History and Literature, and/or Jewish Studies</li>

      <p>Each Postdoctoral Associate will have a dedicated workspace in the DHLab in Sterling Memorial Library; the opportunity to collaborate with technical staff, including a DH Developer and UX Designer; and a budget for computing equipment, professional development, and relocation expenses. The Postdoctoral Associate's primary responsibility will be to his or her own research project. We also expect candidates will be active participants in the intellectual life of the DHLab.
