### Find your Audience

User-centered experiences meet users where they're at so it's helpful to identify your key audiences and the contexts in which your work will reach them. Dissemination means considering how it will be seen, shared, and distributed, whether you're interested in publishing in a print journal, presenting a conference poster, developing a mobile app, or creating a website.


### Define Deliverables

Determining the dissemination approach as well as doing the project planning to arrive at the minimum viable product will help to clearly articulate the desired deliverables for the project. Here are some of the ways project DH deliverables can be described:

<b>Data Visualization</b> â€“ A data-driven visual expression that offers macro views of patterns for large data sets, as well as micro views for individual data points. 

<b>Interactive Infographic</b> - A more narrative form of digital storytelling that curates data into multi-media interactions.

<b>Software Development</b> - Creating a tool that users can process data with, whether it's an existing collection or their own material.

<b>Online Exhibition or Digital Tour</b> - A project website that leverages multi-media interfaces to enrich visual or geospatial analysis of data collections.

These are just some of the many ways digital humanities projects might take shape. 


### Hosting and Storage



### The Devil in the Details

Once you have identified how you want to share your work, take care to mind the details in the project implementation. 

User-Testing - It's always a good idea to test your assumptions on users as you design your project. The Lab can provide advice and support for conducting user testing and research. 

Accessibility - There are many resources for ensuring that your project is built in a way that is accessible to a broad range of users. You can refer to the <a href='https://usability.yale.edu/web-accessibility'>Accessibility Guidelines</a> provided by Yale ITS as well as their best practices for testing and evaluation.
