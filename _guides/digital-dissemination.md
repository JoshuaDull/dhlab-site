<h2 class='subheading'>Visualize and Share Your Work</h2>
There are a number of platforms for visualizing and sharing your digital humanities work. Below are a few free options to try out that require no to some programming knowledge. For more tools that are specific to visualizing certain types of data (for example - network graphs), visit the relevant pages under <a href='{{site.baseurl}}/methods.html' target='_blank'>What is DH </a>.

For tools that contain a suite of visualizations, try:
* <a  href='http://app.rawgraphs.io/' target='_blank'>Raw Graphs</a>
* <a href='http://voyant-tools.org/' target='_blank'>Voyant</a>
* <a href='https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/' target='_blank'>Tableau Public</a> 

For presentation platforms that combine different media types, try:
* <a href='https://www.arcgis.com/home/index.html' target='_blank'>Story Maps</a>
* <a href='https://scalar.usc.edu/scalar/' target='_blank'>Scalar</a>
* <a href='https://omeka.org/' target='_blank'>Omeka</a>

For programming libraries, try:
* <a href='http://ggplot2.org/' target='_blank'>ggplot</a>
* <a href='https://d3js.org/' target='_blank'>D3.js</a>
* <a href='https://plot.ly/python/line-charts/' target='_blank'>plotly</a>

<h2 class='subheading'>User Experience Design</h2>
Designing with the user experience in mind involves thinking carefully about the usability of your project. User-centered designs aim to create efficient, enjoyable experiences. One way to evaluate success on this metric is to conduct user testing at different stages of your project.

One of the first steps in a user-centered design cycle is to gather requirements. Who are the primary users and what tasks are they being asked to perform? What constrainsts might a user face? What information do you most want to convey?

Taking the information collected during the requirement gathering phase, design a few mockups. Be attentive to how your designs will changed when viewed across different platforms â€” the screenspace changes dramatically when moving from a desktop screen to a mobile phone.

After you've selected the leading design, begin prototyping and iterate based on feedback you solicit during the process.

Once you have a working prototype, move on to the evaluation phase of the project. Bring potential users together to try out the design.
