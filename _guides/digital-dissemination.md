### Find your Audience

User-centered experiences meet users where they're at so it's helpful to identify your key audiences and the contexts in which your work will reach them. Dissemination means considering how it will be seen, shared, and distributed, whether you're interested in publishing in a print journal, presenting a conference poster, developing a mobile app, or creating a website.


### Define your Deliverables

Determining the dissemination approach as well as doing the project planning to arrive at the minimum viable product will help to clearly articulate the desired deliverables for the project. Here are some of the ways project DH deliverables can be described:

*Data Visualization* â€“ A data-driven visual expression that offers macro views of patterns for large data sets, as well as micro views for individual data points.

*Interactive Infographic* - A more narrative form of digital storytelling that curates data into multi-media interactions.

*Software Development* - Creating a tool that users can process data with, whether it's an existing collection or their own material.

*Online Exhibition or Digital Tour* - A project website that leverages multi-media interfaces to enrich visual or geospatial analysis of data collections.

These are just some of the many ways digital humanities projects might take shape. 


### Web Hosting

If your project involves a website of some kind, you'll want to find a way to host your project. The following resources provide great web hosting services:

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a services that allows users to host web applications free of charge on their servers. There's a catch though; your site will be run from a static-file server, so you can't run any server-side code with GitHub hosting. If you don't know whether your application requires a server, stop by the lab and we can help you determine.

[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) is a beginner-friendly server provider that lets users run up to three web applications with custom server-side code for free. It's a great first step into digital web hosting if you are working on an application with server-side code.

[Amazon Web Services' EC2 Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/) allow users to host web applications that run custom server-side code. Students get 1 free year of EC2 instances, but afterwards one must pay to use Amazon servers. AWS is harder to use than Heroku, and requires familiarity with server administration. That said, AWS is quickly becoming the industry standard for scalable web hosting.

[Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) is Microsoft's version of AWS. If you like Windows and Microsoft products, you may find Azure easier to work with (though AWS supports Windows as well!)


### Data Storage Providers

If you have lots of data to store, you may want to look into cloud storage providers, such as the following:

[GitHub](https://github.com/) allows users to host tens of thousands of files with up to 1GB of disk space for free in each user repository. For small projects this may be sufficient.

[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com) provides simple, easy to use digital storage. You can store several gigabytes for free, but if you need to store lots of content you'll need to pay a montly fee for storage.

[Amazon Web Services' S3](https://aws.amazon.com/) allows users to upload arbitrarily large data collections. Students get 1 free year of hosting, but must pay thereafter. AWS features a geat "command line interface" with which users can upload and download content from the command line, if you're feeling techy.


### Connecting with your Audiences

Once you have identified how you want to share your work, take care to mind the details in the project implementation. 

User-Testing - It's always a good idea to test your assumptions on users as you design your project. The Lab can provide advice and support for conducting user testing and research. 

Accessibility - There are many resources for ensuring that your project is built in a way that is accessible to a broad range of users. You can refer to the [Accessibility Guidelines](https://usability.yale.edu/web-accessibility) provided by Yale ITS as well as their best practices for testing and evaluation.
