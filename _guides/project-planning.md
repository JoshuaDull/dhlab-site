<h2 class='subheading'>Defining Project Goals</h2>

When starting a project, it's important that all team members have a clear understanding of the core project goals. To that end, we highly recommend drafting a formal overview of your goals. This overview should focus on what needs to be done, not on how those things will be done. 

Those who manage projects for a living often speak of a "minimum viable product" (MVP), or the minimal set of functionality that completes a project's fundamental requirements. If you haven't done so yet, try drafting your own idea of an MVP. Once your draft is complete, ask a colleague if there's anything more than can be removed. Iterating on this process over a period of time can help one identify the fundamental goals of the project.  

For help articulating and prioritizing goals,you might look at the Digital Humanities Lab's <a href='{{site.baseurl}}/assets/docs/DH-LeanCanvas.pdf'>Lean Canvas</a> and <a href='{{site.baseurl}}/assets/docs/DH-Ideation.pdf'>Ideation templates</a>. These are designed to walk researchers through the phases of creating an MVP. For additional templates, you might search online for a "software requirements document."  

<h2 class='subheading'>Identifying Project Timeline</h2>

When working with others on a digital project, it's important that everyone have a shared, manageable timeline within which to complete the work. It's therefore helpful to sketch out early on an overview of all of your major project milestones along with the dates by which you need to achieve those milestones.  

If you're working toward a conference presentation, are on a grant cycle, or otherwise have a date by which you need to wrap up all project work, try working backwards with your timeline to determine whether your full project vision can be achieved in your available time. List all of your project goals, with conservative estimations of the time required for each. If you need help estimating timelines or identifying your project's core milestones, stop by the DHLab so we can discuss your project together!
