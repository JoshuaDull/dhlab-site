<h2 class='subheading'>Defining Project Goals</h2>

When starting a project, it's important that all team members have a clear understanding of the core project goals. To that end, we highly recommend drafting a formal overview of your goals. This overview should focus on what needs to be done, not on how those things will be done. 

Those who manage projects for a living often speak of a "minimum viable product" (MVP), or the minimal set of functionality that completes a project's fundamental requirements. If you haven't done so yet, try drafting your own idea of an MVP. Once your draft is complete, ask a colleague if there's anything more than can be removed. Iterating on this process over a period of time can help one identify the fundamental goals of the project.  

For help articulating and prioritizing goals,you might look at the Digital Humanities Lab's <a href='{{site.baseurl}}/assets/docs/DH-LeanCanvas.pdf'>Lean Canvas</a> and <a href='{{site.baseurl}}/assets/docs/DH-Ideation.pdf'>Ideation templates</a>. These are designed to walk researchers through the phases of creating an MVP. For additional templates, you might search online for a "software requirements document."  

<h2 class='subheading'>Identifying Project Timeline</h2>

When working with others on a digital project, it's important that everyone have a shared, manageable timeline within which to complete the work. It's therefore helpful to sketch out early on an overview of all of your major project milestones along with the dates by which you need to achieve those milestones.  

If you're working toward a conference presentation, are on a grant cycle, or otherwise have a date by which you need to wrap up all project work, try working backwards with your timeline to determine whether your full project vision can be achieved in your available time. List all of your project goals, with conservative estimations of the time required for each. If you need help estimating timelines or identifying your project's core milestones, stop by the DHLab so we can discuss your project together!

<h2 class='subheading'>User Experience Design</h2>
Designing with the user experience in mind involves thinking carefully about the usability of your project. User-centered designs aim to create efficient, enjoyable experiences. One way to evaluate success on this metric is to conduct user testing at different stages of your project.

One of the first steps in a user-centered design cycle is to gather requirements. Who are the primary users and what tasks are they being asked to perform? What constrainsts might a user face? What information do you most want to convey?

Taking the information collected during the requirement gathering phase, design a few mockups. Be attentive to how your designs will changed when viewed across different platforms â€” the screenspace changes dramatically when moving from a desktop screen to a mobile phone.

After you've selected the leading design, begin prototyping and iterate based on feedback you solicit during the process.

Once you have a working prototype, move on to the evaluation phase of the project. Bring potential users together to try out the design.
