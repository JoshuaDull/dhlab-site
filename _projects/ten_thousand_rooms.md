### Overview

The Ten Thousand Rooms Project is a project to build an openâ€“access platform to enable textual work on pre-modern Chinese sources (~13 c. BCE to the 20th century). Building upon the Canvas Viewer developed by Stanford University with support from the Mellon Foundation and supported by YDC2 at Yale, the platform would be a shared workspace to allow users to upload images or digitized texts and crowdsource their transcription, translation, and annotation. In addition to the scholarly contributions of the project, the project will further leverage and develop the tools of digital scholarship in the humanities introduced by the DESMM project. The digital tools and content will be integrated with the YDC2 Digital Content Platform and YDC2 will provide development and project management support.
