<h2 class='subheading'>Overview</h2>

<p>Historian’s Eye is a multimedia documentary project devoted to the peculiar compound of hope and despair that makes up the current political and social climate in Obama’s America. Beginning as a modest effort to capture in photographs and interviews the historic moment of our first black president’s inauguration in early 2009, the project has evolved into a much more expansive collection of some 4000+ photographs and an audio archive of diverse interviews that runs upward of 70 hours. Materials collected from across the country address Obama’s inaugurations and his presidency, the ’08 economic collapse and its fallout, two wars, the raucous politics of healthcare reform, the emergence of a new right-wing formation in opposition to Obama, the politics of immigration, Wall Street reform, street protests of every stripe, the BP oil spill, the Occupy movement, and the spike in anti-Muslim expression nationwide. This project examines the crossroads of American hope and despair in affecting and telling photographs, in the recorded voices of ordinary people, and in spare but evocative textual explanations, as the nation faces unprecedented challenges with a president at the helm who is inspirational to some, fully unnerving to others.</p>
