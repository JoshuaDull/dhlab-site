<h2 class='subheading'>Overview</h2>

<p>This project has been planned to extend research methods and support didactic objectives associated with the Babylonian Collection, which is the largest assemblage of cuneiform tablets, seals and other inscribed artifacts documenting life in Ancient Mesopotamia in the United States. A major aim of the project is to produce and openly disseminate extensive documentation of cuneiform tablets for research applications focused on translating narratives, deciphering meaning and producing scholarship on Old Assyrian, mathematical and Late Babylonian texts. The project will be supported by the digital imaging capabilities of the YDC2 Imaging Lab, the computational analysis capabilities of the Department of Computer Science (CS) and YDC2â€™s ability to manage digital data.</p>
