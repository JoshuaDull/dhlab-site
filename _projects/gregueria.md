### Overview

"La Greguería Virtual," or the Virtual Aphorisms of Ramón Gómez de la Serna, is an online tool that allows scholars and the general public to search a database of 10,000 greguerías (Gómez de la Serna's aphorisms) using various filters or criteria, including specific words, length, and theme. This project is made possible by Corpus Creation and Software Development Seed Grants from the Digital Humanities Lab at Yale University.

### Contributing to the Database

We accept data contributions of all types relating to the languages of Australia. You can [upload files](http://www.pamanyungan.net/chirila/contribute-data-to-chirila/) directly to our site. The more data we have in the database, the more generally useful it will be. We would like, eventually, to have a database that contains words from all the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages in Australia. There are some parts of the country where we don’t have much information at the moment. These include:

* Cape York Peninsula
* Western Arnhem Land and Central Top End
* Southwest Western Australia

We’d be particularly interested in getting in contact with researchers and communities from these regions.
