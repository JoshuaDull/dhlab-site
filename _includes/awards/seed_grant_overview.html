  <p>Workshop grants are to convene digital humanities discussions and training opportunities on campus. Funds might be applied toward food or honoraria and travel expenses for non-Yale participants.</p>

  <p>Past examples: Recipients have brought guest speakers to campus to offer training in a variety of methods, from TEI to mapping. For an example of what these workshops could look like, see the <a href='{{ site.baseurl }}/events/2016-11-29-workshop-with-jessica-marie-johnson.html'>Radical Media and Social Change workshop page.</a></p>

  <p>Corpus Creation grants are to help build machine-actionable datasets for research. Expenses might include digitization, data entry/wrangling, and equipment or software that must be returned to the lab after the grant period. Funds may be used to hire a Yale College or graduate student to work on the project. Recipients will be responsible for finding and, if necessary, training the student(s). DHLab staff can provide an initial training for recipients themselves. Grant recipients are responsible for undertaking 20% of the corpus creation process themselves.</p>

  <p>Past examples: Yale holds an extensive textual and visual collection. Recipients in this track have drawn from these holdings and digitized everything from print runs of The Rivers of America Series to microfilm reels containing revolutionary newspapers from 1940s France, with digitization for these projects being the first step toward computational analysis. Recipients have also generated and cleaned data that was extracted using the APIs for resources such as IMDB and The New York Times.</p>

  <p>Software Development grants are for project prototyping. Funds may be used to hire a Yale College or graduate student to work on the project as a developer or designer. Recipients will be responsible for finding the student(s). DHLab staff can help recipients identify the technical needs of the project for a job call.</p>

  <p>Past examples: Previous recipients have collaborated with Yale developers to engineer software that facilitates scholarly analysis of datasets from hundreds of book illustrations to 10,000 aphorisms. For more on an in-progress project, see <a href='{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/cinecircuits.html'>Cin√©circuits </a>, which began with a Corpus Creation grant and continued its development in year two with funding from the Software Development track.</p>
