  This page shows a "decennial sampling" of Vogue covers — that is, all the covers in one year, every ten years. Overlaying each of the covers for a given year generates a mean RGB value for each pixel.

### Overview

Visual analysis consists of using computational processes to study large collections of images. Some work in this field has focused on using algorithms to study patterns in datasets, such as Lev Manovich’s work on the [covers of Time Magazine](http://manovich.net/index.php/exhibitions/timeline) over time. Others such as the [Early Modern OCR Project](http://emop.tamu.edu/) (eMOP) have focused on using image processing techniques to improve OCR transcription accuracy for researchers working printed texts from the early modern period. Still others, such as researchers at the [University of Nebraska](http://netnebraska.org/article/culture/943643/how-find-poem-200-year-old-newspapers) research team linked below, have used image processing methods to identify poetic passages in unstructured image sets.

### Methods & Tools

While there are fewer open source tools for image analysis than there are for text analysis, there are some great resources you can use to get started in this field. For an overview of some of the operations you can perform on images, try looking at the [scikit-image gallery](http://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/auto_examples/), which includes code that can help perform lots of image operations. Additionally, the links below offer code that can help you accomplish many popular tasks in image processing:

[Transfer styles from one image to another](https://github.com/lengstrom/fast-style-transfer)

[Create fictional images that resemble input images](https://github.com/carpedm20/BEGAN-tensorflow)
