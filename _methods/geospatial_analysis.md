<h3 class='subheading'>Overview</h3>

Geospatial analysis can be used for a variety of projects, from mapping hundreds of thousands of photographs to the routes that characters take in a collection of novels. For some projects, you may want to compare how a place has changed over time. To do that, you could take several maps and overlay them on top of one another through a process call georectification. For other projects, you might be placing points on a map and altering the size or color of the points to show a pattern.  

<h3 class='subheading'>Tools</h3>

There are numerous tools you could turn to for a geospatial project. Popular options for which we often offer workshops on campus include: [ArcGIS](https://www.arcgis.com/home/index.html), [Carto](https://carto.com/), and [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/). To present texts, visuals, and videos alongside maps, try [Story Maps](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/en/) (one product in the ArcGIS line).

For ArcGIS, Yale has an enterprise account that provides affiliates with access to content created by others at the university, as well as free training videos. For more information on how to sign in with your NetID so that you can access these benefits, visit the recommended reading below by GIS Librarian, Miriam Olivares.
