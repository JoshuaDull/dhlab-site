### Overview

Text mining includes a number of applications, from tracking textual reuse and the fluctuation of certain words or themes over time to stylometry and the modeling of literary forms. These texts might represent a single author's oeuvre, a periodical's full print run, or a collection of texts from across multiple centuries. Important to any texutal analysis project is the curation of a dataset, which often entails digitization and optical character recognition (OCR), the process of turning words from images into searchable text.    

### Tools

Out-of-the-box tools that don't require any custom programming include Jstor Labs' [Text Analyzer](https://www.jstor.org/analyze/analyzer/progress), [Voyant](https://voyant-tools.org/), [AntConc](http://www.laurenceanthony.net/software/antconc/), and [Wordle](http://www.wordle.net/create).

Tools that require minimal command line usage include Stanford's [CoreNLP](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/) (which can identify people, locations, and even sentiment in unstructured text) and Andrew McCallum's [MALLET](http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/) (which generates topic models).

Platforms that require some programming include [Bookworm](http://bookworm.culturomics.org/) (for tracking word's frequency over time) and Andrew Goldstone's [dfrtopics](https://github.com/agoldst/dfrtopics/) (for visualizing topic models).

Popular packages that require more intensive levels of programming include [the Natural Language Toolkit](http://www.nltk.org/) and the Python libraries: datasketch, NumPy, SciPy, and scikit-learn.
