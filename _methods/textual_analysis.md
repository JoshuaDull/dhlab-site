<h2 class='subheading'>Overview</h2>

Text mining includes a number of applications, from tracking textual reuse and the fluctuation of certain words or themes over time to stylometry and the modeling of literary forms. These texts might represent a single author's oeuvre, a periodical's full print run, or a collection of texts from across multiple centuries. Important to any texutal analysis project is the curation of a dataset, which often entails digitization and optical character recognition (OCR), the process of turning words from images into searchable text.    

<h2 class='subheading'>Tools</h2>

Out-of-the-box tools that don't require any programming from users include <a href='https://voyant-tools.org/' target='_blank'>Voyant</a>, <a href='http://www.laurenceanthony.net/software/antconc/' target='_blank'>AntConc</a>, and <a href='http://www.wordle.net/create' target='_blank'>Wordle</a>.

Platforms that require some programming include <a href='http://bookworm.culturomics.org/' target='_blank'>Bookworm</a> (for tracking word's frequency over time) and Andrew Goldstone's <a href='https://github.com/agoldst/dfrtopics/tree/43362fd4aea25caedf59f610fb02f3aaa30334ca' target='_blank'>dfrtopics</a> (for visualizing topic models).


Popular packages that require varying levels of programming knowledge include Stanford's <a href='https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/' target='_blank'>CoreNLP</a>, <a href='http://www.nltk.org/' target='_blank'>the Natural Language Toolkit</a>, and the Python libraries: datasketch, NumPy, SciPy, and scikit-learn.
